# RAM / SSD / Laptop Price Emailer (runs on GitHub Actions, no local computer needed)

Emails you a digest of current RAM, SSD, and laptop listing prices across
several Vietnamese retailers (most with Hanoi showrooms), automatically,
via GitHub's free scheduled-workflow runners.

Modeled on [gold-price-emailer](https://github.com/tuongphanbase/gold-price-emailer) and [house-price-emailer](https://github.com/tuongphanbase/house-price-emailer) -
same generate/send two-phase shape, same Gmail-SMTP delivery, same
dedup-via-state-branch trick.

## Important: read this before relying on it

Vietnamese gold prices have a clean daily aggregator site (giavang.org)
with one simple table per seller. **RAM/SSD/laptop prices don't have a
real equivalent.** There's no public site that publishes a clean,
structured, frequently-updated "market price" table for computer
components the way giavang.org does for gold, or even the way Mogi.vn's
blended table does for housing.

What this script does instead is scrape the *listing prices* directly off
each retailer's own category pages - RAM Laptop, SSD, and Laptop - for:

- [MemoryZone.vn](https://memoryzone.com.vn/)
- [HACOM.vn](https://hacom.vn/) - Hanoi-headquartered
- [GEARVN](https://gearvn.com/) - Hanoi showrooms
- [An Phát Computer](https://www.anphatpc.com.vn/) - Hanoi-headquartered
- [ThinkPro](https://thinkpro.vn/) - Hanoi showrooms
- [Hoàng Hà PC](https://hoanghapc.vn/) - Hanoi-headquartered
- [Phúc Anh](https://www.phucanh.vn/) - **disabled by default**, see below
- [Phong Vũ](https://phongvu.vn/) - **disabled by default**, see below

These are **each store's current asking prices** (often already
discounted), not a market average. The email lays each retailer's
listings out side by side, section by section, so you can eyeball and
compare them yourself - it is **not** a single blended price index across
retailers. Treat the email as "what each store is charging right now for
the items on page 1 of each category," not as an authoritative price
index - always check the live page before buying anything.

The parser (`parse_listing()` in the script) matches by *text adjacency* -
a product-name-looking line immediately followed by a "X.XXX.XXX ₫" (or
"đ", or occasionally a bare number with no currency mark glued to it at
all - ThinkPro does this) price line - rather than by exact HTML
structure, so it should survive minor theme/markup changes. A few other
quirks it specifically handles, found while adding each retailer:
- Reads product titles out of `<img alt="...">` where a site puts the
  name there instead of in visible text (HACOM, sometimes An Phát).
- Strips `<script>`/`<style>`/HTML-comment content first so injected
  JS/CSS/comments never get mistaken for a product name.
- Recognizes and skips SKU-code lines ("Mã: ...", "Mã SP: ...") and
  spec-filter chips ("Bus: 3200MHz", "Độ trễ: CL46"...) sitting between
  one product's price and the next product's name, rather than pairing
  them with a distant/unrelated price.
- Drops items with zero extractable spec info (capacity, DDR generation,
  CPU model...) once at least a few real ones were found - catches
  off-topic content that leaks in from an unrelated part of the page,
  like a cross-department "hot deals" sidebar HACOM shows on every
  category page (robot vacuums, PS5s, barcode scanners - real products,
  just not RAM/SSD/laptops).

**Render mode per retailer** - some sites server-render their product
grid (a plain HTTP GET already contains the prices - fast, no browser
needed); others fetch it via client-side JS after the page loads (a plain
GET sees an empty grid, so this script renders those pages in a real
headless Chromium tab via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) first).
All of the below is confirmed by actually running against the live sites,
not just guessed from URL patterns - several sites turned out to need a
browser despite looking "classic" at a glance (GEARVN in particular:
Shopify-style `/collections/...` URLs, but actually runs on Haravan, and
its product grid is 100% client-rendered).

| Retailer | Render mode |
|---|---|
| MemoryZone | plain HTTP |
| HACOM | headless browser |
| GEARVN | headless browser |
| An Phát Computer | headless browser |
| ThinkPro | headless browser |
| Hoàng Hà PC | headless browser |
| Phúc Anh | headless browser (but blocked - see below) |
| Phong Vũ | headless browser (but blocked - see below) |

**Phúc Anh and Phong Vũ** both sit behind a Cloudflare challenge that
doesn't clear even for a real headless browser. In both cases the
challenge page itself reports "verification successful," but the run
never gets past the interstitial - across multiple separate runs, several
retries with extra wait time each, both stayed stuck at the exact same
"waiting for [site] to respond" point every time. That consistency points
to Cloudflare correctly identifying the automation rather than a one-off
timing issue. This script does not attempt to defeat that detection (no
fingerprint spoofing, proxies, CAPTCHA solving, etc.), so both are
**excluded from the default `ENABLED_RETAILERS` list**. They're still
defined in the script if you want to try either anyway (e.g. from a
residential connection rather than a GitHub Actions runner) - see
"Choosing which retailers get scraped" below.

If a run reports 0 parsed items for a retailer/category that isn't Phúc
Anh or Phong Vũ, open the category URL and check `parse_listing()`, and
the `JUNK_NAME_PREFIXES` / `JUNK_NAME_RE` filters near the top of the file
(tuned by hand per site's nav/filter text, so a redesign - or a new site -
may need a line or two added there).

## What the email looks like

Items are grouped by **type first** (Laptop → RAM → SSD → HDD → VGA →
Mainboard → PSU → Màn hình), each
with every enabled retailer's offers listed underneath - makes it easy to
compare the same kind of item across retailers without scrolling through
each store's full catalog separately. Each row has a product thumbnail
(pulled from the listing page, including lazy-loaded images), the name
and extracted specs, the price (with a discount badge and crossed-out
original price when on sale), and a 7-day/1-month/6-month/1-year price
trend line (see below). The thumbnail, name, and price all link to the
product's page where one was found, falling back to the category page
otherwise.

Not every retailer has every category - most have all 8, but **ThinkPro**
only has RAM/SSD/Laptop/Monitor (they don't sell VGA, Mainboard, or PSU
as separate PC-building components; they're a laptop/gadget retailer
rather than a PC-parts one). The full list of category URLs per retailer
lives in `RETAILER_DEFAULTS` near the top of the script - each is also
individually overridable via an environment variable, e.g.
`HACOM_VGA_URL`, following the same `<RETAILER>_<CATEGORY>_URL` pattern
as the RAM/SSD/Laptop examples further down this README.

## One-time setup (~5 minutes)

1. **Create a GitHub account** if you don't have one: <https://github.com/join>

2. **Create a new repository**

   - Click "+" (top right) -> "New repository"
   - Name it anything, e.g. `ram-ssd-laptop-price-emailer`
   - Set it to **Private** (recommended, keeps your workflow config private)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload these files** to the repo (drag-and-drop works fine via the
   GitHub web UI: "Add file" -> "Upload files"), keeping the folder structure:

   - `ram_ssd_laptop_price_emailer.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `.github/workflows/send-tech-price.yml`

4. **Create a Gmail "App Password"** (your normal Gmail password won't work):

   - Turn on 2-Step Verification: <https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification>
   - Then create an app password: <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>
   - Choose "Mail" as the app, copy the 16-character password it gives you.

5. **Add your secrets to the repo** (this keeps your email/password out of the code):

   - In your repo: Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> "New repository secret"
   - Add three secrets:
     * `GMAIL_ADDRESS` = your Gmail address
     * `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` = the 16-character app password from step 4
     * `TECH_RECIPIENT` = the email address that should receive the price update

6. **Test it manually**

   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repo
   - Click "Send RAM/SSD/Laptop Price Email" on the left
   - Click "Run workflow" -> "Run workflow" (green button)
   - Wait **1-3 minutes** (installing the Chromium browser for HACOM/Phong
     Vũ, on top of rendering 6 categories through it, takes noticeably
     longer than the original MemoryZone-only version), refresh, click
     into the run to see logs / confirm success
   - Check the logs for each retailer/category line and confirm none of
     them say "0 items parsed" or show a render error - if one does, see
     the note above about `parse_listing()` (HACOM) or dropping the
     retailer from `ENABLED_RETAILERS` (Phong Vũ, if it's the bot
     detection)
   - Check the recipient inbox for the email

That's it - from now on it runs automatically on the schedule below.

## Changing the schedule

Open `.github/workflows/send-tech-price.yml` and edit this line:

```
- cron: "23 */3 * * *"
```

Cron format is `minute hour day month weekday`, always in **UTC**.

- `23 */3 * * *` -> every 3 hours, at 23 minutes past - current setting
- `*/30 * * * *` -> every 30 minutes
- `0 1 * * *` -> once a day at 1am UTC (8am Vietnam, UTC+7)
- `0 1 * * 1` -> once a week, Monday 1am UTC
- `0 */6 * * *` -> every 6 hours

Retail listing prices don't move nearly as often as gold, so daily or
weekly is probably plenty - and keeps `SEND_ONLY_ON_CHANGE` (below) doing
useful work instead of just discarding runs. It's also worth considering
now that two of the three retailers render through a headless browser:
every-30-minutes means Chromium gets installed and six category pages get
rendered every half hour, which eats into your Actions minutes faster
than the original MemoryZone-only version did.

## Only emailing on price changes

Currently `SEND_ONLY_ON_CHANGE` is `"true"` in the workflow's "Generate
email" step. With that on, `generate` hashes the freshly scraped prices
across all retailers, compares against a hash saved from the last run -
stored in `state/last_price.json` on a dedicated `tech-price-state` branch
the workflow creates/updates automatically - and skips the email if
nothing changed anywhere. Set it to `"false"` if you'd rather get an email
on every scheduled run regardless.

## Price history / trend indicators (7 days, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year)

Each item in the email shows a small line under its name like:

```
7 ngày ▼3%   ·   1 tháng ▲5%   ·   6 tháng —   ·   1 năm —
```

Green/down = price dropped since that point, red/up = price rose, gray
"—" = not enough history yet for that window.

**This only works if the workflow keeps running over time** - every
`generate` run records that day's price for every item into
`state/price_history.json` (same `tech-price-state` branch as the dedup
hash above), keyed mainly by each item's product-page URL so it can be
matched up across runs even as the page's listing order changes. A
window's percentage only appears once a price point from roughly that far
back actually exists - so right after setting this up, expect to see "—"
everywhere, with "7 ngày" filling in after about a week of runs, "1
tháng" after about a month, and so on. Old points beyond ~400 days are
pruned automatically so the state file doesn't grow forever.

A few things worth knowing:
- Items matched by product URL track cleanly across runs. Items with no
  product-specific link found (falls back to a `site|category|name` key)
  are less robust - if the retailer tweaks that exact name text, this
  script sees it as a "new" item and its trend history resets.
- This is a comparison against whatever this script happened to scrape
  each day, at a single point in time - it doesn't capture intraday
  price changes or days the workflow didn't run (e.g. if it was paused,
  or a run failed).
- If you run the workflow more often than once a day, only that day's
  latest price is kept for trend purposes (same-day runs overwrite each
  other) - trend windows are day-granularity, not run-granularity.

## Choosing which retailers get scraped

By default 6 of the 8 retailers run (all except Phúc Anh and Phong Vũ -
see above). To change that, add an `ENABLED_RETAILERS` environment
variable to the "Generate email" step in the workflow, as a
comma-separated list from: `memoryzone`, `hacom`, `gearvn`, `anphat`,
`phucanh`, `thinkpro`, `hoangha`, `phongvu`. For example, to only check
MemoryZone (the one retailer that doesn't need a headless browser, so
this runs noticeably faster):

```
ENABLED_RETAILERS: "memoryzone"
```

Or to try Phúc Anh/Phong Vũ again despite the note above:

```
ENABLED_RETAILERS: "memoryzone,hacom,gearvn,anphat,phucanh,thinkpro,hoangha,phongvu"
```

## Configuring which pages get scraped

These are optional environment variables you can add to the "Generate
email" step in the workflow if you want different category pages or a
different number of items. Each retailer has its own RAM/SSD/Laptop URL
variables:

```
# MemoryZone
MEMORYZONE_RAM_URL: "https://memoryzone.com.vn/ram-laptop"     # or e.g. .../ram-pc
MEMORYZONE_SSD_URL: "https://memoryzone.com.vn/ssd"
MEMORYZONE_LAPTOP_URL: "https://memoryzone.com.vn/laptop"

# HACOM
HACOM_RAM_URL: "https://hacom.vn/ram-laptop"
HACOM_SSD_URL: "https://hacom.vn/o-cung-ssd"
HACOM_LAPTOP_URL: "https://hacom.vn/laptop"

# GEARVN
GEARVN_RAM_URL: "https://gearvn.com/collections/ram-laptop"
GEARVN_SSD_URL: "https://gearvn.com/collections/ssd-o-cung-the-ran"
GEARVN_LAPTOP_URL: "https://gearvn.com/collections/laptop"

# An Phat Computer
ANPHAT_RAM_URL: "https://www.anphatpc.com.vn/ram-laptop.html"
ANPHAT_SSD_URL: "https://www.anphatpc.com.vn/o-cung-hdd-ssd_dm1314.html"
ANPHAT_LAPTOP_URL: "https://www.anphatpc.com.vn/may-tinh-xach-tay-laptop.html"

# Phuc Anh
PHUCANH_RAM_URL: "https://www.phucanh.vn/bo-nho-trong-linh-kien-pc.html"
PHUCANH_SSD_URL: "https://www.phucanh.vn/o-cung-ssd.html"
PHUCANH_LAPTOP_URL: "https://www.phucanh.vn/may-tinh-xach-tay-laptop.html"

# ThinkPro
THINKPRO_RAM_URL: "https://thinkpro.vn/ram"
THINKPRO_SSD_URL: "https://thinkpro.vn/o-cung"
THINKPRO_LAPTOP_URL: "https://thinkpro.vn/laptop"

# Hoang Ha PC
HOANGHA_RAM_URL: "https://hoanghapc.vn/ram-bo-nho-trong"
HOANGHA_SSD_URL: "https://hoanghapc.vn/o-cung-the-ran-ssd"
HOANGHA_LAPTOP_URL: "https://hoanghapc.vn/laptop"

# Phong Vu (excluded by default - see above)
PHONGVU_RAM_URL: "https://phongvu.vn/c/ram-laptop"
PHONGVU_SSD_URL: "https://phongvu.vn/c/o-cung-ssd"
PHONGVU_LAPTOP_URL: "https://phongvu.vn/c/laptop"

MAX_ITEMS_PER_CATEGORY: "24"   # applies per retailer per category
```

For backward compatibility, the original `RAM_URL` / `SSD_URL` /
`LAPTOP_URL` variables still work and apply to MemoryZone specifically, so
existing workflows that already set those don't need to change anything.

## Notes

- Every retailer except MemoryZone needs a real headless browser
  (Chromium via Playwright) since their product grids are client-rendered
  by JS rather than present in the initial HTML. This makes each run
  slower and uses more Actions minutes than the original MemoryZone-only
  version - see the schedule note above if you're on the free tier's
  2,000 min/month.
- The workflow needs write access to push its dedup state branch. It
  requests this itself (`permissions: contents: write` at the top of
  `send-tech-price.yml`), but some accounts/orgs override that and force
  the token to read-only regardless. If the "Persist dedup state to state
  branch" step fails with `403` / `Permission ... denied` / `exit code 128`, go to **Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions** in your repo and select **"Read and write permissions"**, then re-run
  the workflow.
- GitHub Actions free tier includes 2,000 minutes/month for private repos.
- You can also trigger it manually anytime via the "Run workflow" button.
- If the run fails, check the Actions tab -> the failed run -> logs. Common
  causes: a secret is missing/misspelled, the Gmail app password was
  revoked, or one of the three sites changed its page markup (see below).
- If a run reports "0 items parsed" for a retailer/category, that site's
  HTML structure probably changed. Open the relevant category URL, check
  that product cards still show a name directly above/near a "X.XXX.XXX ₫"
  price, and adjust `parse_listing()` (and possibly `JUNK_NAME_PREFIXES` /
  `JUNK_NAME_RE`) in `ram_ssd_laptop_price_emailer.py` to match.
- Always worth checking each site's current `robots.txt` / terms before
  running this unattended long-term:
  <https://memoryzone.com.vn/robots.txt>,
  <https://hacom.vn/robots.txt>,
  <https://phongvu.vn/robots.txt>
- This is a personal price-watch tool, not investment or purchase advice.
