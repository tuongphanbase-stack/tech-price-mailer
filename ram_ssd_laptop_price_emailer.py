RAM / SSD / Laptop Prices (MemoryZone.vn + HACOM.vn + PhongVu.vn) -> Email
(runs on GitHub Actions, no local computer needed)

Same shape as the gold-price-emailer / house-price-emailer this is modeled
on: fetches price data, then emails an HTML digest via Gmail SMTP. Runs in
two phases so the workflow can persist dedup state *between* them (see the
accompanying GitHub Actions workflow):

    python ram_ssd_laptop_price_emailer.py generate
        -> scrapes each retailer's three category pages, writes the
           composed email (subject/html/text) under ./email/, and updates
           the "last sent price" state file

    python ram_ssd_laptop_price_emailer.py send
        -> reads ./email/* and sends it via Gmail SMTP

SOURCES & AN IMPORTANT CAVEAT
-----------------------------
Vietnamese gold prices have a clean daily aggregator (giavang.org) with one
simple table per seller. RAM/SSD/laptop prices don't have a real
equivalent: there's no single site that publishes a clean, structured,
frequently-updated "market price" table the way giavang.org does for gold.

What this script does instead is scrape the live *listing prices* off
several retailers' category pages, currently:

    - MemoryZone.vn       (memoryzone.com.vn)
    - HACOM.vn             (hacom.vn)          - Hanoi-headquartered, showrooms
                                                  across Hanoi (Hai Ba Trung,
                                                  Dong Da, Cau Giay, Ha Dong, ...)
    - Phong Vu             (phongvu.vn)        - nationwide chain, Hanoi showrooms.
                                                  Disabled by default - sits behind a
                                                  Cloudflare challenge that hasn't
                                                  cleared even for a real headless
                                                  browser in testing; see the note
                                                  further down and in README.md.
    - GEARVN               (gearvn.com)        - nationwide chain, Hanoi showrooms
    - An Phat Computer      (anphatpc.com.vn)   - Hanoi-headquartered
    - Phuc Anh              (phucanh.vn)        - nationwide chain, Hanoi showrooms
    - ThinkPro              (thinkpro.vn)       - nationwide chain, Hanoi showrooms
    - Hoang Ha PC           (hoanghapc.vn)      - Hanoi-headquartered (Cau Giay,
                                                  Dong Da showrooms)

These are each store's own asking prices (often with an active discount),
NOT a market-average and NOT a single unified price-comparison - the email
just lays each retailer's listings out side by side so you can eyeball
them. Treat this as "what each store is currently charging for the items
on page 1 of each category", not as an authoritative RAM/SSD/laptop market
index.

If you want a true cross-retailer comparison, a price-comparison site
(e.g. websosanh.vn) would be a better source, but those tend to load
listings via JavaScript rather than server-rendering them, which a plain
HTTP scraper can't read. If you find a clean scrapable source for that,
parse_listing() below is where to wire it in.

Because retail listings can reshuffle/reprice frequently, consider
SEND_ONLY_ON_CHANGE=true (see below) if you'd rather only get an email
when the scraped set of prices actually changes.

SETUP
-----
1. Install dependencies:

    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 certifi playwright
    python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium

   (The playwright browser install is a one-time step - HACOM and Phong Vu
   load their product grids via client-side JS, so those two categories
   are rendered in a real headless Chromium tab rather than fetched with
   a plain HTTP GET. MemoryZone doesn't need this - its pages are
   server-rendered - but installing it doesn't hurt.)

2. Create a Gmail "App Password" (regular Gmail passwords won't work with SMTP):
    - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
    - You need 2-Step Verification turned on first.
    - Create an app password for "Mail" and copy the 16-character code.

3. Set these as environment variables (see README.md for GitHub Actions
   secrets instead, if running in the cloud):

    export GMAIL_ADDRESS="youraddress@gmail.com"
    export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="16-char-app-password"
    export TECH_RECIPIENT="where-to-send@example.com"
    export SEND_ONLY_ON_CHANGE="false"          # optional, default false
    export TIMEZONE="Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"          # optional, for the subject line
    export ENABLED_RETAILERS="memoryzone,hacom,gearvn,anphat,thinkpro,hoangha"
                                                 # optional, default is all EXCEPT phongvu and phucanh (see notes below)
    export MAX_ITEMS_PER_CATEGORY="24"          # optional
    export STATE_FILE="state/last_price.json"   # optional, dedup state file
    export ALLOW_INSECURE_SSL_FALLBACK="false"  # optional, last-resort TLS bypass

    # Optional per-retailer category URL overrides (defaults shown):
    export MEMORYZONE_RAM_URL="https://memoryzone.com.vn/ram-laptop"
    export MEMORYZONE_SSD_URL="https://memoryzone.com.vn/ssd"
    export MEMORYZONE_LAPTOP_URL="https://memoryzone.com.vn/laptop"
    export HACOM_RAM_URL="https://hacom.vn/ram-laptop"
    export HACOM_SSD_URL="https://hacom.vn/o-cung-ssd"
    export HACOM_LAPTOP_URL="https://hacom.vn/laptop"
    export PHONGVU_RAM_URL="https://phongvu.vn/c/ram-laptop"
    export PHONGVU_SSD_URL="https://phongvu.vn/c/o-cung-ssd"
    export PHONGVU_LAPTOP_URL="https://phongvu.vn/c/laptop"

    # Backward-compatible aliases (apply to MemoryZone only, kept so
    # existing workflows that already set these don't break):
    export RAM_URL / SSD_URL / LAPTOP_URL

NOTE ON SCRAPING
-----------------
Always worth checking each site's current robots.txt / terms before
running this unattended long-term, e.g.:
    https://memoryzone.com.vn/robots.txt
    https://hacom.vn/robots.txt
    https://phongvu.vn/robots.txt

The page markup can change at any time - if `generate` reports 0 parsed
items for a category, open that category's URL and inspect the product
cards, then update parse_listing() below. It matches by *text adjacency*
(product name line immediately followed by a "X.XXX.XXX ₫" price line),
not by exact HTML structure, which should make it reasonably resilient
across different storefront templates - but no guarantees, and it can't
distinguish "in stock" from "sold out" items.

MemoryZone server-renders its product grid, so a plain HTTP GET is
enough. HACOM does not - its product grid is fetched by client-side JS
after the page loads, so this script renders that page in a real headless
Chromium tab (via Playwright) first and parses the resulting HTML.
Phong Vu is attempted the same way, but that site also runs active bot
detection that may block even a real headless browser - if so, it will
show up as a fetch/render error in the logs for that category, not a
silent 0-items result. Because this now spans three sites with two
different fetch strategies, it's worth doing a first manual `generate`
run and checking the parsed item counts for each retailer/category before
relying on the schedule.

This is a personal price-watch tool, not investment or purchase advice -
always confirm the actual price on the retailer's site before buying.

    - image_urls: "the most recently seen product image URL" for each
      line, so a name/price pair can carry a thumbnail along with it. A
      line inherits the nearest *preceding* image in the DOM, which lines
      up with how these storefront cards are laid out (thumbnail, then
      title/SKU, then price) whether the name itself came from an
      <img alt> (HACOM-style) or a plain text node (MemoryZone-style).
    - link_urls: the href of the nearest *enclosing* <a> tag for each
      line (see _nearest_link) - i.e. the product page link, since these
      cards are normally one big <a> wrapping the thumbnail/name/price.

    Many storefronts - HACOM included - render the product title only as
    an <img alt="..."> for SEO/lazy-loading reasons, with no matching
    plain-text node anywhere on the card (the visible on-page text next to
    the price ends up being just the SKU code, e.g. "Mã: RAKT0273").
    soup.get_text() only sees text nodes, so it silently skips the real
    title and this script would otherwise "successfully" pair the price
    with the SKU line instead - wrong, but not a 0-items failure, so easy
    to miss. Interleaving alt text back into the sequence (in the same
    position it occupies in the DOM) lets the name-immediately-before-price
    heuristic in parse_listing() find the real title again.

    <script>/<style>/<noscript>/<template> contents are stripped first -
    BeautifulSoup's text walk otherwise includes raw <script> text too
    (a well-known gotcha), and on a Next.js site like HACOM that text
    includes RSC streaming payloads such as
    `self.__next_f.push([1,"153:T622,"])` for every chunk of the page -

def generate_price_dashboard(categories_data, price_history, timestamp):
    """Writes docs/index.html and docs/dashboard-data/<category>.json: an
    interactive price-history browser (category tabs, retailer filters,
    search, a sortable table, click a row for its price chart) hosted via
    GitHub Pages, with real hover-for-exact-value tooltips via Chart.js.

    Built the same way as the currency-rate-emailer project's dashboard —
    a real webpage with real JavaScript, since email clients run none and
    an HTML-image-map alternative (no JS needed) tested correctly in that
    project's controlled tests but did not work in real Gmail — adapted
    here for a much larger, less uniform dataset (hundreds of items across
    8 categories, vs. 13 fixed currencies there). A grid of small charts
    doesn't scale to hundreds of items, so this is a browsable/searchable
    table instead, and each item's chart is fetched on demand (that
    category's JSON chunk) rather than every item's full history being
    embedded in the page up front — with price history capped at 400 days
    per item across potentially hundreds of items, embedding everything
    would make the initial page load heavy for no benefit, since only a
    handful of items get clicked into per visit.

    Requires GitHub Pages enabled on the repo (Settings > Pages > Deploy
    from a branch > main > /docs) - something only the repo owner can do,
    not this script. Returns the path written, or None if there's nothing
    to show yet.
